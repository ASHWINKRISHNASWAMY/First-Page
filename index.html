          <p>down the street you can hear her scream</p>
          <p>"you're a disgrace"</p>
          <p>as she slams the door in his drunken face</p>
          <p>and now he stands outside</p>
          <p>and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool</p>
          <p>he cries "oh girl, you must be mad</p>
          <p>what happened to the seet love you and me had"</p>
          <p>against the door he leans and starts a scene</p>
          <p>and his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
          <p>and so castles made of sand,</p>
          <p>fall in the sea eventually</p>
          <p>a little indian brave who before he was ten</p>
          <p>played war games in the woods with his indian friends</p>
          <p>and he built a dream that when he grew up</p>
          <p>he would be a fearless warrior indian chief</p>
          <p>many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow</p>
          <p>he would sing his first war song</p>
          <p>and fight his first battle but something went wrong</p>
          <p>surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
          <p>and so castles made of sand</p>
          <p>melts into the sea eventually</p>
          <p>there was a young girl whose heart was a frown</p>
          <p>because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound</p>
          <p>and she wished and prayed she would stop living</p>
          <p>so she decided to die</p>
          <p>she drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore</p>
          <p>and to her legs she smiled</p>
          <p>"you won't hurt me no more"</p>
          <p>but then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
          <p>"look a golden winged ship is passing my way"</p>
          <p>and it really didn't have to stop</p>
          <p>it just kept on going</p>
          <p>and so castles made of sand</p>
          <p>slips into the sea eventually</p>
